Source: https://plugins.andkindness.com/license-agreement

While most of our plugins source code are publicly available, they are, unless specified otherwise, not free software. To use any plugin in production, you need to purchase a license.

## Summary

This license is a legal agreement between **You** and **Love & Kindness GmbH, Beimoorstr. 20, 22081 Hamburg, Germany** (therein "**Our**"/"**We**"/"**Us**") for the use of any Kirby CMS plugins and resources (the "**Plugin**") created by Us and sold via Paddle.com. By downloading any Plugin files or resources or purchasing a license to the Plugin, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license.

## Permitted Use
This agreement grants a license for each purchase to install and use a single instance of the Plugin on a **specific website** limited by **its domain & subdomain**. If You use the cross-domain multi-language feature with the same `content` folder, these domains count as the same Website.

Additional Plugin licenses must be purchased in order to install and use the Plugin on **additional websites**.

The license is **non-exclusive** and **generally non-transferable**.

A license is valid for all minor & patch updates of the Plugin (e.g. 1.0.x to 1.1.x). We reserve the right to charge an **upgrade fee for major updates** (e.g. 1.x.x to 2.x.x). Whether a release is a patch, minor, or major release is at Our sole discretion.

## Development Usage
You are permitted to install and use the Plugin on a personal computer (such as a desktop PC, notebook, or tablet) or a server, free of charge, for as long as necessary during the development stage.

Any website that is used **purely for the purposes of development and client preview** is considered development usage. It must only be accessible by a restricted number of users. A website with **the intention to handle production data** is never considered development usage, no matter if the related website is publicly accessible or not.

## Refund Policy
We offer refunds on the Plugin within **14 days of purchase**. Contact support@andkindness.com for assistance.

## Technical Support
Technical support is available via email for active license owners.

No support is provided for free plugins or plugins that are available both for free and paid usage. We do not provide phone support. No representations or guarantees are made regarding the response time in which support questions are answered, but we will do our very best to respond quickly.

## All Rights Reserved
Love & Kindness GmbH **owns all rights**, title and interest to the Plugin (including all intellectual property rights) and **reserves all rights to the Plugin** that are not expressly granted in this Agreement.

## Restrictions

### Making Copies

You may not reproduce the Plugin or its source code, in whole or in part, for **any other purpose**.

### Modification of the Source Code

### Disclaimer of Warranty
THE PLUGIN IS OFFERED ON AN **"AS-IS" BASIS** AND **NO WARRANTY**, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, IS GIVEN. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, INSTALLATION AND USE OF THE PLUGIN INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, LOSS OF DATA OR SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, OR UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS. **YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE** FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USE OF THE PLUGIN AND ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE.

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT **WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE** FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, **SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU**. **IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE DAMAGES EXCEED** THE FEES YOU PAID TO US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. THIS PARAGRAPH ALSO APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE NOT THE LICENSEE (E.G. IF YOU USE THE PLUGIN WHILE SOMEONE ELSE IS THE LICENSEE).

## Termination
The License may be terminated by either party if terms are breached and not remedied within a specified period.

## Governing Law
Any legal disputes that arise from or relate to this Agreement shall be exclusively resolved in the courts located in Hamburg, Germany. Nonetheless, we reserve the right to initiate legal proceedings against you in the jurisdiction where your principal place of business is situated.

Should you be domiciled in Germany, the stipulations of the first paragraph will be relevant only if you are a businessperson, a public law entity, or a special fund under public law.

If your domicile is not in Germany but within another member state of the European Union, the provisions of the first paragraph will apply to you only if you do not qualify as a consumer as defined under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012. In such circumstances, you may bring a legal action against us either in the jurisdiction of our place of business or where you habitually reside. Conversely, we are entitled to sue you exclusively in the courts of the member state where you have your domicile.

In the event that your residence is outside Germany and not within any European Union member state, the provisions of the first paragraph are fully applicable without any modification.

## Severability Clause
Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid, void or unenforceable, in whole or in part, at present or in the future, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The same shall apply if a gap requiring supplementation arises after conclusion of this Agreement. The parties shall replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provision or gap requiring filling by a valid provision which in its legal or economic content takes account of the invalid, void provision and the overall content of the agreement. § 139 BGB (partial invalidity) is expressly waived.
